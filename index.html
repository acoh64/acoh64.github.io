						</header>

						<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/grad2.jpg" alt="" /></a>

						<p>I grew up in Needham, MA, and got my early education through the Needham Public Schools system. Throughout high school,
							I played a lot of tennis and participated on the cross country and squash teams.
							After high school, I moved to the midwest to attend the University of Chicago.
							At UChicago, I studied Molecular Engineering and Computer Science. I was also president of the club tennis team 
							and spent most of my weekends running practices for other students and members of the Hyde Park community.
							I am now a second year PhD student in chemical engineering and computational science and engineering at MIT. I am a member of the 
							<a href="https://math.mit.edu/~dunkel/">Dunkel</a> and <a href="http://bazantgroup.mit.edu/">Bazant</a> groups.
							In my free time, I play on the MIT club tennis team and host trivia nights for the chemical engineering department.
							I also spend many weekends hiking and camping in the white mountains in New Hampshire.</p>

								This paper integrates real data from indoor air quality measurements with quantiative models of airborne disease transmission to develop a data-driven control strategy for indoor airborne disease transmission. 
								In particular, introduce a control strategy called transmission-controlled ventilation (TCV), which dynamically adjusts outdoor air ventilation to maintain a desired risk of airborne disease transmission while also optimally reducing energy cost.
								TCV achieves this optimal performance by using carbon dioxide measurements to estimate occupancy and incorporating all air cleaning mechanisms into the transmission model.

								This paper was my first first-author publication in graduate school. We develop a general method of representing biophysical systems with a mode representation. We also develop a physically-constrained 
								inference method for learning models in this representation from data. The models can be used to compare dynamics across biophysical systems.

								This paper was from my first-ever research project. I studied how blue phase liquid crystals (BPLCs) can be stabilized and controlled in confinement. These confined BPLCs could be used as microscale sensors, as they can be designed
								to change colors in the presence of specific chemicals.

								This paper came from my undergraduate honors thesis research project. I developed a coarse-grained model for polymers with aisotropic interactions, such as conjugated polymers. We studied the single-chain properties of such polymers,
								which is useful in designing organic photovoltaic and other organic electronic devices.

								This paper was my first paper of graduate school. We showed how quantitative models of indoor airborne disease transmission can be used with CO<sub>2</sub> measurements to get real-time risk assessment in buildings. Working on this paper was especially meaningful to me,
								as my grandmother had passed away a few months prior from COVID-19, and she always loved hearing about my research.

								This was my first paper from my internship with IBM Research. We studied current-driven domain wall motion in synthetica antiferromagnets. This behavior has potential to be used in neuromorphic computer chips.
