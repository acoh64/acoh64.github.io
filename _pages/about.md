I am a final year PhD student at MIT [CSE](https://cse.mit.edu//) and [ChemE](https://cheme.mit.edu//).
I am advised by [JÃ¶rn Dunkel](https://math.mit.edu/~dunkel/) and [Martin Bazant](https://cheme.mit.edu/profile/martin-z-bazant/) and funded by an NDSEG fellowship.
I work on machine learning methods for discovering physically-constrained differential equations from data and then controlling and optimizing these systems. I have applied these methods across many fields including biophysics, neuroscience, animal behavior, batteries, and materials.
I am excited about all things related to AI for science.

I did my undergrad at the University of Chicago, where I started my research career at the [Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering](https://pme.uchicago.edu/) studying [liquid crystals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_crystal) and [conjugated polymers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductive_polymer) with Professor [Juan de Pablo](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/juan-de-pablo).

Outside of research, I enjoy tennis, squash, hiking, triathlons, trivia, and almost all sports/games.
